SUB-FINDER

This is a solution created to facilitate equitable substitute assignments by randomly selecting 
interested faculty. Interested faculty can use reactions to express availability and interest in
a request posted to the corresponding slack channel. 

1. Download and unzip the git then navigate to the folder using command line or terminal. 
2. npm install any dependencies!
3. Use node app.js in command line to run the app locally! 
3. Make sure to install the app to the workspace and to invite the bot to the "substitute-finder" channel.
